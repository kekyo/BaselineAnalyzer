## BLA0011: Asynchronous method 'Foo' must include the 'Async' suffix

When implementing an asynchronous method,
it is customary to add `Async` to the end of the method name:

```csharp
// Despite being an asynchronous method, `Async` is not added to the end of the method name
public Task Foo()
{
    // ...
}
```

This can be fixed by adding `Async` to the end of the method name:

```csharp
// Async method, so the method name ends with `Async`
public Task FooAsync()
{
    // ...
}
```

Whether a method is asynchronous or not is detected by the following conditions:

* Methods that return a type of `Task` or `ValueTask` and its generic version.
  * Methods that return `Task` or `ValueTask` and its generic version type,
    except for the `static Main` method in the case of `Task`.
* Methods that return the type of `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`.
  * Excepts for extension methods (Assuming asynchronous operators such as `System.Linq.Async` package.)

#### Why is this?

There are a number of possible reasons,
but one is that it is a convention that has been in place since the introduction of `async-await` in C#.
When `async-await` was first introduced,
overloads could not be used to add asynchronous versions of existing synchronous methods,
so this was used as a naming convention to make them distinguishable.

For example, the `Stream` class has a `Read` method, but the asynchronous version of this method had the advantage of requiring a different method name and making it clear that it was an asynchronous method:

```csharp
// .NET Standard Stream class
public class Stream
{
    // ...
    
    // Read data from stream (synchronous version)
    public abstract int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count);

    // Read data from the stream (added asynchronous version)
    public abstract Task<int> ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count);
}
```

As shown above, even if you try to add a method that returns `Task<int>`,
you cannot do so due to the rules of overloading
(you cannot define multiple overloads with the same argument signature).
