## BLA0021: Using 'Wait/Result' in asynchronous methods may cause deadlock

Within the implementation of the asynchronous method,
there is a call to the `Task.Wait()` method and a reference to the `Task.Result` property:

```csharp
public string Foo(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    // Call the asynchronous method and wait synchronously for the `Result`
    var result = httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://example.com/").Result;
}
```

Be sure to use the `async-await` clause to wait "asynchronously" for the result of an asynchronous method:

```csharp
public async Task<string> FooAsync(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    // Wait asynchronously using the `await` clause, without using `Result`
    var result = await httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://example.com/");
}
```

### Why?

When you use `Task.Wait()` or `Task.Result`,
the thread is forcibly paused there. As a result:

* In the case of a GUI application,
  the entire application will be suspended until the asynchronous method finishes,
  as it is usually only using the main thread to operate.
* In the case of a server-side application,
  it will no longer be possible to reuse threads,
  leading to a deterioration in concurrent execution performance.
* If the code is complicated, it may deadlock and not move until the application is forcibly terminated.

You may think that none of the above problems apply to your code.
However, please look again at the correction method.
It is not that difficult to write correct code.

If you continue to implement it ignoring the recommended implementation pattern for asynchronous methods,
be prepared for the fact that you will have to go through a lot of trouble to fix a large amount of code later on.
