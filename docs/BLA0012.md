## BLA0012: Synchronous method 'FooAsync' must not include the 'Async' suffix

When implementing a synchronous method, adding `Async` to the end of the method name can cause confusion:

```csharp
// Despite being a synchronous method, the `Async` suffix is added to the end of the method name
public int FooAsync()
{
    // ...
}
```

You can fix this by removing `Async` from the end of the method name:

```csharp
// As this is a synchronous method, `Async` is not appended to the end of the method name
public int Foo()
{
    // ...
}
```

#### Why is this?

This is the opposite pattern to `BLA0011`.
