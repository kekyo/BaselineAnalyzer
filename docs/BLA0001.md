## BLA0001: The catch block does not contain a throw statement

This occurs when you write code that exits the `catch` block without throwing an exception when an exception is `caught`:

```csharp
public void Foo()
{
    try
    {
        // Do something...
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Caught an exception!");

        // Wasn't threw the exception...
    }
}
```

This kind of code can ignore dangerous situations that the exception contains.
Here is an example of how to fix the problem:

```csharp
public void Foo()
{
    try
    {
        // Do something...
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Caught an exception!");
        
        // Re-throw the exception
        throw;
    }
}
```

As shown above, there is no problem if the exception is thrown within the `catch` block.
Alternatively, you could wrap the exception in another exception and throw it:

```csharp
public void Foo()
{
    try
    {
        // do something...
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Caught an exception!");
        
        // Wrap the exception and throw it
        throw new FormatException("Invalid form", ex);
    }
}
```

#### Why?

Exceptions are there to tell us that something exceptional has happened,
that is, an abnormal situation that would not normally occur has occurred.

Not throwing an exception in a `catch` block could lead to you "ignoring" an abnormal situation,
and you could fail to notice a bigger problem.
It is better not to suppress exceptions in order to detect such situations at an early stage.
